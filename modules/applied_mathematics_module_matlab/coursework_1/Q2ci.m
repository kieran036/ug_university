 %Specific case of function Q2c when k = 0.3, x0 = 1, delta = 10^-14 and
 %nmax = 1000
Q2c( 0.3, 1, 10^-14, 1000)

%A plot of the exponential function x_n = k*e^(x_(n-1)) and its loglog plot at its specific inputs as mentioned above to demonstrate its
%convergence to a spefic value for a specific case of the inputs. In this
%case the function converges to 0.4894 (to 4dp) and the loglog plot shows
%that it has taken only 46 steps for the sequence to converge according to
%the criteria that was set. The other intersection point was 1.7813 (to
%4dp)
