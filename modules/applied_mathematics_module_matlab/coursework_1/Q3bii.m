%Up to k ~ 0.37 the LogarithFunc sequence was steadily decreasing. At k =
%0.5, it returned the solution to be -0.1339 since we were required to use the absolute
%value of x in the function. Using the absolute value of x introduces
%another solution so the function diverged to the solution, -0.3517 (to
%4dp) as the sequence reached nmax
