%Specific case of function Q3ap1 when k = 0.3, x0 = 1, delta = 10^-14 and
%nmax = 1000
Q3ai( 0.3 , 1 , 10^-14 , 1000 )
 
%A plot of the exponential function x_(n+1) = ln(|x|/k) and its loglog plot at its specific inputs as mentioned above to demonstrate its
%convergence to a spefic value for a specific case of the inputs. In this
%case the function converges to 1.7183 (to 4dp), as opposed to the earlier solution, 0.4894 (to 4dp), which is the root which is shown in Q2c and the loglog plot shows
%that it has taken only 57 steps for the sequence to converge according to
%the criteria that was set.
